  <h1>⚽ Welcome to the Football Universe</h1>
  <p>
    Football, also known as soccer in some countries, is the most popular sport in the world, played and loved by billions of people across every continent. It is more than just a game — it is a culture, a passion, and a universal language that connects people regardless of nationality, age, or background. From small street matches to massive international tournaments watched by millions, football brings excitement, teamwork, and unforgettable memories.

The sport is played between two teams of eleven players each, with the main goal of scoring by putting the ball into the opponent’s net. What makes football special is its simplicity — all you need is a ball and a space to play. Despite this simplicity, the game includes incredible strategies, skills, and teamwork that make every match unique and thrilling.

Fans celebrate football not only for the competition but also for the emotions it creates — joy, tension, pride, and unity. Whether you support a local club or a national team, football gives people something to believe in and cheer for together. Welcome to the Football Universe, where passion meets sport.
